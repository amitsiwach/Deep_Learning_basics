# Deep Learning projects

This repository contains various Deep Learning projects e.g.,:
  1. MNIST dataset classification using ANN
  2. Activation functions used in deep learning along with their derivatives. Advantages and Disadvantages of the respective activation functions have also been discussed.
  3. Implementation of Perceptron Class in Python
  4. Tranfer Learning use case
  5. Implementation of ANN model for classification using Numpy library (without using Keras). Then, compared the model's performance with ANN model implemented using Keras library.
  6. Regression_example_using_ANN
  7. Batch Normalisation example using both approaches.
      a) Batch Normalization AFTER between Layers respective Activation Functions
      b) Batch Normalization IN between Layers & their respective Activation Function (with No Bias)
  8. Regularization techniques and type pf Loss functions
