# Deep Learning projects

This repository contains various Deep Learning projects e.g.,:
  1. MNIST dataset classification using ANN
  2. Activation functions used in deep learning along with their derivatives. Advantages and Disadvantages of the respective activation functions have also been discussed.
  3. Implementation of Perceptron Class in Python
  4. Tranfer Learning use case
  5. Implementation of ANN model for classification using Numpy library (without using Keras). Then, compared the model's performance with ANN model implemented using Keras library.
